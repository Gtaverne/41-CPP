Lobsters are a family (Nephropidae, sometimes also Homeridae) of large marine crustaceans.

Lobsters have long bodies with muscular tails, and live in crevices or burrows on the sea floor.
Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, including the first pair, which are usually much larger than the others.
Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable
commodities in coastal areas they populate.

Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word "lobster" in their names,
the unqualified term "lobster" generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family
Nephropidae.[3] Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper
lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters.
The most similar living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and
the three families of freshwater crayfish.
